# README

I finished the first run-through of the video course so I decided to look at the other study material available to me on O'Reilly. This cert guide is in eBook format and it includes prompts to test your knowledge throughout the book.

I'm going to start working through this guide while I work on my more hi-fi notes based on the video series I just finished.

I tend to prefer to read written content over watching videos. I believe I'll fill in some gaps by adding this new material.
