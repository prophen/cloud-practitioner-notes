# Study Notes for AWS Cloud Practitioner Exam

I've started a \#NikemaLearns blog series on [nikemaprophet.com](https://nikemaprophet.com) to document my learning in public. My first area of focus is DevOps and more specifically, preparing for the AWS Cloud Practitioner Exam. This gitbook will be a place to keep detailed notes that I can then link to my blog post updates.
